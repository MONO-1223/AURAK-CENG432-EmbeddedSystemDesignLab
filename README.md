The TM4C123G LaunchPad evaluation kit is an affordable platform designed for development with Arm Cortex-M4F-based microcontrollers (MCUs). Powered by the 80-MHz 32-bit Arm Cortex-M4F CPU, the kit features the TM4C123GH6PM MCU, which offers 256KB of flash memory, 32KB of SRAM, and 2KB of EEPROM. This MCU is equipped with a range of communication capabilities, including USB 2.0 support for host, device, and on-the-go (OTG) operations, as well as two 12-bit analog-to-digital converter modules. It also provides various serial communication interfaces such as UART, SPI, I2C, and CAN, enabling flexible connectivity for different applications. Notable features of the TM4C123G LaunchPad include its hibernation and PWM modules, which enhance its power management and motion control capabilities. The EK-TM4C123GXL kit also comes with programmable user buttons, an RGB LED, and stackable headers that allow easy connection to BoosterPack™ plug-in modules, enabling users to expand the functionality of the platform via the Texas Instruments BoosterPack ecosystem. To streamline development, the TivaWare SDK, provided by Texas Instruments, includes drivers for all onboard peripherals and example code for a wide range of applications. The TM4C123G LaunchPad is a versatile evaluation platform for embedded systems, offering a high-performance MCU and comprehensive development tools. The Tiva 4C development board includes an onboard debugger for debugging programs in Keil MDK. However, to establish a communication link between Keil and the development board, your PC requires the installation of In-Circuit Debug Interface (ICDI) drivers.

### Microprocessor vs. Microcontroller
It’s also useful to distinguish between microprocessors and microcontrollers in the context of embedded systems:
- **Microprocessor**: A CPU, like Intel's Core i7 or ARM Cortex-A series processors, that typically requires external memory and peripherals to function. Microprocessors are used in systems where high computational power and external devices are needed, such as in personal computers or complex embedded systems.
- **Microcontroller**: A self-contained chip that integrates the CPU, memory, and I/O peripherals, designed for embedded applications. Microcontrollers like the STM32L476 and TM4C123G are optimized for low-power, real-time control tasks with built-in connectivity, making them ideal for systems where power efficiency and compact design are key.

### Intel DE2-115 vs STM32L476 vs Tiva TM4C123G
The Intel DE2-115 Cyclone IV-E FPGA board, STM32L476 microcontroller, and Tiva TM4C123G microcontroller represent different platforms with distinct strengths, designed for various embedded applications. Each offers unique features suited to specific tasks, ranging from high-performance computing to low-power embedded control. While the FPGA and microcontrollers serve different roles, they can complement each other in hybrid designs. FPGAs, like the DE2-115, are ideal for handling high-speed, parallel processing tasks, such as custom hardware modules for signal or image processing. Microcontrollers, like the STM32L476 or TM4C123G, excel in managing system control, communication, and low-speed tasks. For instance, in a robotics system, the FPGA might be used to process vision data in real-time, while the microcontroller handles motor control, sensor interfaces, and higher-level decision-making. Both platforms can interface with external peripherals like sensors, displays, and communication modules, but they do so in different ways. The FPGA might handle real-time, parallel data acquisition, while the microcontroller processes and configures the peripherals. The Intel DE2-115 Cyclone IV-E FPGA is typically placed at the heart of high-performance computing systems or subsystems that require high customization and parallelism, excelling in tasks like cryptography, video processing, or AI acceleration. It is often integrated with microcontrollers or CPUs through buses or memory-mapped interfaces. In contrast, the STM32L476 microcontroller is better suited for low-power, real-time control tasks, commonly used in IoT devices, wearables, and portable instrumentation. It interfaces with sensors, handles communication protocols, and controls actuators while conserving energy. Meanwhile, the Tiva TM4C123G microcontroller offers a reliable and cost-effective solution for general-purpose embedded tasks, such as in educational setups or small robotics, providing effective control and logic management. However, it is less optimized for low-power applications than the STM32L476 or high-performance tasks compared to the DE2-115 FPGA.
